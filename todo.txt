 there is two ways to prove that fast melbo works
 one is the unit testing, the other is showing the same 
 backdoor elicitation vectors as the original method.
 And I can just do that
 therefore, 
 - a file with the code
 - a file for backdoor validation
 - a file for performance comparison
 - a readme

 in the readme, mention:
 - installation
    - pip install fast-melbo
    - or just copy paste the file into your project
 - added features
    - support for models loaded in half precision
    - much faster
    - No support for orthogonal vectors
- the reason we didn't add this to the original repo
    is because we are in the sleeper agents project
    and may continue working on this method and modifying it 
    further in the future. One avenue maybe to add support for
    orthogonal vectors (we are pretty happy with vectors not supporting)
    this for now, however, we may revisit this in the future and
    take insipiration from this
